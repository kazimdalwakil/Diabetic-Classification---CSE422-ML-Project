# Diabetic-Classification-CSE422-ML-Project
It is a simple Machine Learning project where I tried to classify if a person has Diabetes or not. I collected the dataset from Kaggle.

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database">Dataset Link</a>

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

After pre-processing the dataset, I splitted the dataset into 75:25 ratio. 75% data for training and 25% data for testing.

I used three classification models:

    Decision tree
    Random Forest
    K-neighbors classifier
